# Platformer game
This is a tutorial I am following by RealTutsGML. I like his style.. he explains stuff well and gets on with it.
I have used this engine a few times now and I make little tweaks along the way, one day I will have the balls to make my own
but I am still learning on the java game devel journey.
As always feel free to contribute and comments are always welcome.
