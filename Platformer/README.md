# Platformer game
This is a tutorial I am following by RealTutsGML. I like his style.. he explains stuff well and gets on with it.
I have used this engine a few times now and I make little tweaks along the way, one day I will have the balls to make my own
but I am still learning on the java game devel journey.
As always feel free to contribute and comments are always welcome.

## 06/06/2019 - Player animation, backgrounds, changed level a bit
So I am still going through the video's and it is making sense to me, basically just adding functions on top of functions without breaking them. I stole the player sprite sheet from the tut because to be honest I am too tired to make one but I will make one which will not be as good as his but at least it will be my own. There are clouds now! I might add some different ones, maybe a sun or birds or something. its midnight. I am off to bed.

## 31/05/2019 - Collision! Textures! Level Loading/Editing!
Tonight I have added basic collision, Some very smart person has told me I need to look into [AABB](https://tutorialedge.net/gamedev/aabb-collision-detection-tutorial/) "Axis-Aligned Bounding Box". Which i will do after finishing this tutorial. Level has been added, this was fun, basically a 512x512 png file that each pixel represents a 32x32 block in the game making it easy to draw out levels, will play more with this tomorrow. Also added textures, but that is pretty old hat now. G'Nite!!

## 30/05/2019 - Should be studying
Tonight I added the player, set up the gameObject to use non abstract variables for x,y,velX,velY so we could access them from other classes
Just an FYI for anyone thinking why isnt he finishing triviaTowers?? I am doing this tutorial to better trivia towers. I am interested in the physics of game dev and I like the way RealTutsGML teaches... go check him out.
