# Platformer game
This is a tutorial I am following by RealTutsGML. I like his style.. he explains stuff well and gets on with it.
I have used this engine a few times now and I make little tweaks along the way, one day I will have the balls to make my own
but I am still learning on the java game devel journey.
As always feel free to contribute and comments are always welcome.

Tonight I added the player, set up the gameObject to use non abstract variables for x,y,velX,velY so we could access them from other classes
Just an FYI for anyone thinking why isnt he finishing triviaTowers?? I am doing this tutorial to better trivia towers. I am interested in the physics of game dev and I like the way RealTutsGML teaches... go check him out.
